<p>Net neutrality is the principle that all Internet service providers must treat all data the same. For example: Verizon cannot launch a competitor to Netflix and throttle Netflix's speeds because they want their competitor to do better than Netflix. The goal of Verizon would be to have their Netflix competitor perform better. Currently, the United Statesdoes not have net neutrality.The FCC repealed the Net Neutrality law.</p>
